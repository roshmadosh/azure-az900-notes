### Describe factors that can affect costs in Azure
- resource type
- consumption/usage
- maintenance (deprovisioning a VM but forgetting to do so for the other resources created with it)
- geography
- subscription type (e.g. trial account)
- Azure MarketPlace: allows use of third party vendor tools, which themselves may incur their own costs.
  
### Compare the Pricing calculator and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator
The Pricing Calculator helps you determine the cost of deploying a resource in Azure. The TCO calculator tells you how much you would save after switching from your on-premises setup to one on Azure.  

### Describe the Azure Cost Management and Billing tool
Set up budgets, cost alerts, monitor and forecast your spending.

### Describe the purpose of tags
Tags are optional key-value pairs you can assign to resources to organize them. You can group by these tags to perform operations or to calculate costs.
